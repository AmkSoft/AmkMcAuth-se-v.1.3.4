// What is Changed in this version (1.3.4) AmkMcAuth-se (Small-Server Edition)
//
// This version has the upgrades to work like then "Big-Server Edition" AmkMcAuth
// But without MySQL, Email etc., still the basics with add-ons.
//
// Code-fixup, removed old unused code.
//
// New-Features:

// added invisibleMode // # Set players that are not logged in to invisible mode?
// invisible_mode: false

// added OnJoin  event (Join-Event when connects to the server).
// added OnRgstr event (Join-Event when new Player has to Register his PlayerName).
// added OnGrace event (Join-Event when Player was loggedin before: Grace login/No password).
// added OnLogin event (Login-Event when Player correctly loggs in using "/login" command).
// added OnLogof event (Logoff-Event when Player logges off using "/logoff" command).
// added OnExit  event (Leave-Event when Player disconnects from the server).

// Every event console command execution can be delayed by a number of game-ticks
// To delay a command start the command-line with the parameter: AmkWait(NumberOfTicks),
// Where NumberOfTicks is the number of game ticks to wait before running the command.
// The parameter has to be "AmkWait(..)" otherwise AmkMcAuth will run this command without waiting.
// If you wait to long the player might be logged off resulting in a message like" "No player was found".  

// added teleportToSpawnWorld		Name of the world where the player spawns when a player joins
// added useSpawnAtLocation  		"flag" to tell that there are XYZ coordinates have to be used (default=false)
// added spawnAtLocationX			The X coordinate where the player is put (spawn coordinates)
// added spawnAtLocationY			The Y coordinate where the player is put (spawn coordinates)
// added spawnAtLocationZ			The Z coordinate where the player is put (spawn coordinates)

// These new settings can only be used when teleport_to_spawn is true
//  tpToSpawnTrue:
//    # Spawn in special world (Default="": use default server spawn setting)
//    teleportToSpawnWorld: ""
//    # useSpawnAtLocation to Spawn at specific Location XYZ coordinates (default=false: use default server spawn setting)
//    useSpawnAtLocation: false
//    # if useSpawnAtLocation=true: Spawn at this XYZ coordinates location (must be a valid spawn point/block, otherwise horror??)
//    spawnAtLocationX: 0
//    spawnAtLocationY: 66
//    spawnAtLocationZ: 0

// See AmkMcAuth config.yml file for details (includes usage documentation).
